# C++ Practice Assignments

This repository contains a collection of C++ assignments and exercises that I solved while revising the language.
The goal of this repo is to gather all the practice work in one place and to track my progress in learning and improving my C++ skills.

## Contents

* **Cpp1\_ws â€“ Cpp8\_ws**: Different sets of assignments and practice problems.
* Each folder includes code files that cover topics like:

  * Variables and basic I/O
  * Functions and arrays
  * Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
  * Templates
  * Problem-solving exercises

I will keep adding new exercises as I continue my journey with C++ programming.
