# C++ Practice Assignments

This repository contains a collection of C++ assignments and exercises that I solved while **revising the language**.
The repo is not a tutorial, but a way to gather all my practice work in one place and to track my revision progress.

## Topics Covered

* Basics: variables, arrays, pointers, functions
* Object-Oriented Programming: classes, inheritance, polymorphism
* Templates and STL
* Exception handling
* **Modern C++ features**: smart pointers, move semantics, lambda expressions
* **Design patterns** (implemented in C++ as part of the revision)
* Problem-solving exercises combining multiple concepts

## Purpose

* To organize all the assignments I worked on during my revision
* To review and strengthen my knowledge in both classic and modern C++
* To practice applying **design patterns** in modern C++ contexts
* To serve as a reference for myself, and maybe helpful for others revising C++

This repo will keep growing as I continue revising **C++** and exploring more **modern features and design patterns**.
