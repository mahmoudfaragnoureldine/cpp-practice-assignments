# C++ Practice Assignments

This repository is a collection of C++ assignments and exercises that I solved while revising the language.
It gathers all my practice work in one place and shows my progress with both **classic and modern C++ concepts**.

## Whatâ€™s inside

The assignments cover a wide range of topics, including:

* Basics: variables, operators, arrays, pointers
* Functions and memory management
* Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
* Templates and generic programming
* Standard Template Library (STL)
* Exception handling and error management
* Modern C++ features (smart pointers, move semantics, lambda expressions, etc.)
* Problem-solving exercises that combine multiple concepts

## Purpose

* To organize my practice code in one repository
* To track my improvement in **C++ problem-solving and modern programming techniques**
* To serve as a reference for myself and for others who are revising C++

I will keep adding new exercises as I continue learning and practicing **C++ (including modern standards)**.
